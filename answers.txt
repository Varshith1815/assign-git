1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A: The Gitignore file instructs Git to overlook certain types of files when committing changes from the local repository to the remote repository.
   In general, we may add any file extensions that we believe are unnecessary, but from what I've observed, we most typically add any target/temp folders or any war files
   produced during the build of a Java project.

2. What does fast-forward in git mean?
A: Fast-forward is when there are no conflicts between the master and the current feature branch git directly merges
   the feature branch changes into the master repository by pointing it to the latest commit 
 
3. Why should you have different branches?
A: We can isolate the work by establishing subsidiary branches that are unrelated to the primary branch.
   The branch structure aids in the resolution of code disputes by keeping the critical work in a master branch and isolating specialized changes in a separate branch.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A: We can have multiple remote repositories in a project as long as we manage them effectively. In general we have a master repository where all the tested work is merged and
   several remote repositories where we make changes to the code and push them into master.
